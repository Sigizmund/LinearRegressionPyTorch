# LinearRegressionPyTorch
My First Steps in The Amazing World of Deep Learning :)

This PyTorch model predicts the weight and bias of a linear regression (the formula of a linear regression: y = ax + b, a - weight, b - bias)

Uses gradient descent and backpropagation that are implemented in PyTorch (L1Loss, SGD)
